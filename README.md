# Suicide Prevention Bot

This is a simple Twitter bot that replies to tweets that seem suicidal with the phone numbers of Suicide Prevention Helpline and the Crisis Text Line.
It, unfortunately, does not detect sarcasm well (a very simple sentiment analysis is carried out, nonetheless) due to the limited research in this field so it replies to sarcastic tweets as well. However, one might argue that if it saves a life, it is worth the many false positives the bot might reply to.
